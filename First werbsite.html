        Although I am only 21 years of age, I feel as if 
        time is no longer on our side. My family gets smaller 
        as the years pass. I no longer have any grandparents, 
        and the rest of the family rarely talks or gets along. 
        I'm sure each reader thinks about how they really wish 
        they appreciated their youth more, 
        but we can't stop time; we can only cherish it.

        <h2>Tick tock...tick tock...
Life is counting down on your internal clock.

Memories that feel as if they occurred yesterday
turn to flashes of moments that seem to fade away.

People you once knew
walk by without a clue.

The times you once shared
exist as if you were never there.

Years fly...friends die...
and you never know when you'll say your last goodbye.

Oh, how I wish I could turn back time,
spend it with loved ones and cherish what once was mine.

Or to go back even more,
being a kid in a candy store.

How I miss the way I used to feel
on Christmas day when Santa was real.

But back to reality...back to today,
family is scarce and memories continue to fade away.
